      "The method used here is *Fast Marching wavefront tracking*. In this algorithm the entire first arriving wavefronts from each source are calculated across the entire model in the form of a *travel time field* one per source. Travel times and ray paths are then calculated by tracing rays back from a desired receiver position to the source along the perpendicular to the wavefronts. This uses the *Fast Marching method* which is stable in highly heterogeneous velocity models. Here we implement a version of Fast Marching with source grid refinement for improved accuracy, as described in the papers below. \n",

      "The goal in travel-time tomography is to infer details about the velocity structure of a medium, given measurements of the minimum time taken for a wave to propagate from source to receiver. For seismic travel times, as we change our model, the route of the fastest path from source to receiver also changes. This makes the problem nonlinear, as raypaths also depend on the sought after velocity or slowness model. \n",
      "\n",
      "Provided the 'true' velocity structure is not *too* dissimilar from our initial guess, travel-time tomography can be treated as a weakly non-linear problem. In this notebook we optionally treat the ray paths as fixed, and so it becomes a linear problem, or calculate rays in the velociuty model.\n",
